    <p>
      In Level 1, VNPS students will learn the fundamental photography skills: how to use and operate their camera
      properly, how to incorporate five photographic components (line, shape, form, light, and color) in composing an
      aesthetic image. In addition, they will also learn the rule of thirds in photographic composition. In the new era
      of digital photography, photo image post processing plays a major role in how good a photograph will turn out. The
      students will be learning the basics steps on how to edit the photo in Photoshop CC Camera Raw. To re-enforce the
      principles learned in the class room, the Level 1 students will have at least 15 photography field trips with
      hands-on guidance from the VNPS instructors. These field trips are designed to give the student opportunities to
      practice taking photographs on various subjects in landscape photography, event & action photography, street
      photography, and night time photography.
